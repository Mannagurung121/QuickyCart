## Getting Started ‚ö°

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mannagurung121/QuickyCart.git
cd QuickyCart

Open project in Xcode
	‚Ä¢	Open QuickyCart.xcodeproj in Xcode
	‚Ä¢	Make sure your iOS deployment target matches your device/simulator

3. Add your own API keys

Since secret files are hidden, you need to add:
	1.	Service.plist (your Ship24 API key)
	2.	Info.plist (app info)
	3.	GoogleService-Info.plist (Firebase / Google related info)

Place them in the QuickyCart folder.

4. Build & Run
	‚Ä¢	Select a simulator or your real device
	‚Ä¢	Press Run in Xcode (Cmd + R)
	‚Ä¢	The app will fetch shipments and display real-time tracking info

‚∏ª

Notes üìù
	‚Ä¢	Ensure your device or simulator is connected to the internet
	‚Ä¢	The app currently only works with the Ship24 API
	‚Ä¢	Hidden files should never be pushed to GitHub
